This balance is often referred to as \\u201Ccriticality.\\u201D And the term \\u201Cself-organized\\u201D is often added because systems tend to become fractal on their own, simply by putting a lot of system components together and allowing them to exchange information.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Fractals also come into play within the internal attractor structure of personality, which organizes self-similar patterns of behavior at various scales of observations. A timid middle-aged housewife tries to enter the professional world once her children have grown and her nest is empty.

Coincidentally, similar themes of disconnection and invisibility have also appeared in a dream from the night before.

Similarly, one\\u2019s life-partner will be more likely to drive you crazy than the moon.From the micro-level of speech patterns, through a medium-scale event of a chance encounter on the highway, to the large-scale level of ongoing business relations, people generally demonstrate self-similar behavior across multiple scales of observation. When this gets rigidly stereotyped, we might think in terms of Freud\\u2019s notion of repetition compulsion. But a certain degree of self-similar repetition of behavior is natural, perhaps representing the characteristic \\u201Csignature\\u201D of personality by which others recognize us and we recognize ourselves.
